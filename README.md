2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
3. Explore the Blue Zones Map, take the survey, learn about the Blue Zones Project, and discover information about countries using the Rest Countries API.

## Features Implementation
**Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets, or maps and display information about it in your app:

I have effectively organized city data in the cityData array. Each element in the array corresponds to a city, containing information such as city_id, city_name, and city_details.
The showDialog function utilizes this array to dynamically generate content for the dialog box based on the city that the user clicks on the map. This demonstrates the effective use of arrays and objects to manage and present data.

**Visualize data in a user-friendly way (e.g., graph, chart, etc.):

The interactive map with clickable areas represents a visually appealing way to explore information about the original Blue Zones. Each city is clickable, and the information is displayed in a user-friendly way.
The dialog itself, showing city details in a structured format, serves as an effective visualization of the data. The styling and design choices contribute to a positive user experience.

**Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app OR Create a form and store the submitted values using an external API (e.g., a contact form, survey, etc.):

I successfully integrated data from the Rest Countries API by using the fetch function to obtain information about various countries.
The retrieved data is then used to dynamically generate content for each country, displaying flags, population, region, and capital. This showcases the integration of external API data into my application, enriching it with real-world information.
